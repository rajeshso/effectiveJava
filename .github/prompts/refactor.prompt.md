# Prompt: Refactor Java Kata Code for Clarity and Performance

You are working on a long-standing Java coding kata practice project using IntelliJ IDEA. The project uses:

- Java version: `JavaVersion.VERSION_23`
- Gradle version: `8.14`
- Multi-module structure

## Objective

Refactor existing Java classes to improve readability, maintainability, and performance. Focus on idiomatic Java and clean code principles.

## Guidelines

- Use Java 23 features where appropriate (e.g., record patterns, unnamed variables).
- Eliminate redundant code and simplify logic.
- Ensure all public methods are covered by parameterized JUnit tests.
- Maintain compatibility with existing module structure and Gradle setup.
- Avoid introducing external dependencies unless absolutely necessary.

## Notes

- Prioritise readability and testability.
- Refactor in a way that supports future kata extensions.
