# Prompt: Set Up a New Gradle Module for Java Kata Project

You are working on a long-standing Java coding kata practice project using IntelliJ IDEA. The project uses:

- Java version: `JavaVersion.VERSION_23`
- Gradle version: `8.14`
- Multi-module structure

## Objective

Help set up a new Gradle module within this project. The module should be compatible with Java 23 and follow the existing project conventions.

## Guidelines

- Use Gradle's `java-library` plugin.
- Ensure the module is added to `settings.gradle`.
- Include a basic `build.gradle` file with dependencies and Java version settings.
- Add a sample class and a corresponding parameterized JUnit test.
- Follow naming conventions consistent with other modules in the project.

## Notes

- Assume the project uses groovy for Gradle.
- Do not include unnecessary boilerplate.
- Keep the setup minimal but functional.
