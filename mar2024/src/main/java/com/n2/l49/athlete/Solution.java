/**
 * Problem:
 *
 * This lab focuses on improving an existing Java program that manages an athlete repository. The program currently suffers from a bug in identifying "rare" athletes.
 *
 * Background:
 *
 * The program stores information about athletes, including their name, height (in centimeters), and profession. There's a general correlation between height and profession: tall athletes (over 180cm) are typically basketball players, while shorter ones are not.
 *
 * Current State:
 *
 * The program includes a sample list of athletes:
 * ```
 * private final static List<Athlete> ATHLETES = new ArrayList<>();
 * static {
 *   ATHLETES.add(new Athlete("Bob", 190, "basketball"));
 *   ATHLETES.add(new Athlete("Alex", 170, "soccer"));
 *   ATHLETES.add(new Athlete("Frank", 130, "basketball"));
 *   ATHLETES.add(new Athlete("Scotty", 175, "basketball"));
 *   ATHLETES.add(new Athlete("Jane", 190, "chess"));
 * }
 * ```
 * In this example, Bob and Alex are considered "typical" athletes as their height aligns with their profession. However, Frank, Scotty, and Jane are classified as "rare" due to the bug.
 *
 * Your Task:
 *
 * Your objective is to fix the bug in the printAll function responsible for identifying rare athletes. Additionally, you're encouraged to enhance the code quality by making it more readable, maintainable, and efficient. Remember, the existing functionality of printAll should remain unchanged (e.g., handling null inputs with exceptions).
 *
 * Testing:
 *
 * The problem provides two sample test cases:
 *
 * Mike (175cm, hockey): Mike is considered a "typical" athlete (not rare) due to his height and chosen profession.
 *
 * Invalid Input (Java 15, etc.): This seems like an example of invalid data where the input might not be in the expected format (athlete information). The expected behavior is to handle such cases appropriately (e.g., throwing an exception).
 *
 * Deliverable:
 *
 * Refine the existing code by fixing the bug and improving code quality.
 * Ensure your code maintains the original functionality of printAll.
 * Bonus:
 *
 * Consider implementing unit tests to verify your changes and improve code robustness.

/**
 * Explanation of Improvements:
 * Corrected Logic in isRareAthlete Method: The logic now correctly identifies rare athletes. It checks if a tall athlete (height >= 180) is not a basketball player or if a shorter athlete (height < 180) is a basketball player.
 * Use of Getters: The Athlete class uses getter methods to access the private fields.
 * Consistent Naming Conventions: Method and variable names follow Java naming conventions.
 * Simplified printAll Method: The printAll method directly returns a list of rare athlete names.
 * Handling Null and Empty Lists: The printAll method checks for null and empty lists and handles them appropriately.
 * Fixed String Comparison: Used equals method for string comparison instead of != to compare professions correctly.
 */
/**
 * Method Extraction:
 *
 * Extracted isTallPlayer and isBasketballProfessional methods to improve readability and clarity.
 * These methods encapsulate the conditions for being tall and for being a basketball professional, making the main condition in isRareAthlete easier to understand.
 * Use of equals for String Comparison:
 *
 * Used equals for comparing the profession string to avoid potential issues with ==.
 * Consistent Use of final Keyword:
 *
 * Used final for method parameters to indicate that they should not be modified within the method.
